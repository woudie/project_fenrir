## What is Project Fenrir?

Project Fenrir is a small side-project that I am using to explore quadruped robots. The goal is to build a highly modular and feature rich quadruped robot eventually, but a long the way explore and learn all the fun little components that go into the successful design, fabrication, and usage of a quadruped robot.

## Motivation

I've been interested in legged robots ever since I learned about boston dynamics spot and have always wanted to mess around with them. I always thought they were too complicated to get into, but that was until I did small quadruped group project. Now after what I learned from that project, I want to take it further and build a fun quadruped that I can use to learn complex topics related to robotics and quadrupeds in particular like gait planning, trajectory generation, control stability, and more. 

## What's in this repo?

I am planning to use this repository as a sort of record for everything I learn and everything I do; this includes both hardware and software components. Organization of this repo is tbd, I haven't thought of the best way to format it just yet

## Timeline
I am intending for this to be a long term project so I can milk the learning opportunity like crazy.

TODO (for me): seperate readme's, this is one reads better as a starter to explain inspiration, but should make another read me when project is further along.
